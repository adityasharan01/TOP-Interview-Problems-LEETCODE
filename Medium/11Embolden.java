Embolden
Given a string text and a list of strings patterns, implement an embolden function where all substrings in text that match any string in patterns are wrapped in <b> and </b> tags. If two patterns are adjacent or overlap, they should be merged into one tag.

Constraints

n < 5000 where n is the length of text
m < 100 where m is the length of patterns
Example 1
Input
text = "abcdefg"
patterns = ["bc", "ef"]
Output
"a<b>bc</b>d<b>ef</b>g"
Explanation
bc and ef match the text and are wrapped in <b> and </b> tags.

Example 2
Input
text = "abcdefg"
patterns = ["bc", "de"]
Output
"a<b>bcde</b>fg"
Explanation
If two patterns are adjacent or overlap, they should be merged into one tag.
  
Hint1:Find all intervals that need to be made bold.
  
JAVA SOLUTION NOT AVAILABLE 
Intuition
The idea is simple: build a list of "flagged indices" which indicate that we should bold letters at this index. Then when we look through the original text, we have ranges to open and close our bold tags.

Implementation
Create a painting list of indices to paint
Populate with values to be painted, based on index.
Go through the original text and insert bold tags before and after we have found a string in indices to bold
Time Complexity
\mathcal{O}(n * m)O(nâˆ—m), where n is len(text) and m is len(max_word) in pattern.

Space Complexity
\mathcal{O}(n)O(n), bolded stores n length values

"""
text = "abcdefg"

patterns = ["bc", "ef"]

convert letters to list of yes or not bold:

0:False
1:True
2:True
3:False
4:True
5:True
6:False

go through string and turn ranges back into bolded
